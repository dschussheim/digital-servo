Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-993] The Pblock pblock_1 has defined an area that causes the splitting of interconnect tile columns. Partial reconfiguration requires that the left and right paired interconnect tile columns cannot be split by a reconfigurable boundary.  This is caused by either the left or right edge of a Pblock boundary, or by the Pblock spanning over logic types not included in the Pblock ranges.  To avoid an unroutable situation, placement will be prohibited from both of these columns. To avoid placement restrictions, modify the Pblock to avoid splitting the two columns.
The column of the split contains interconnect tile INT_L_X40Y124  (RAMB18_X3Y48 RAMB18_X3Y49 RAMB36_X3Y24).
Please refer to the Xilinx document on Partial Reconfiguration.
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON, or modify the column/X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Constraints 18-997] The split between the left and right columns occurs between a reconfigurable Pblock and Static logic.  The static sites are reconfigurable.  The Pblock should either be extended to include the right column, or reduced to remove the left column.
Resolution: Set the Pblock property SNAPPING_MODE to value of ON, or modify the column/X specification of the pblock to avoid this edge.
