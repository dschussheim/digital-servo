INFO: [Route 35-57] Estimated Timing Summary | WNS=-1.354 | TNS=-16.097| WHS=-0.361 | THS=-3.277 |

WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.
Phase 10 Post Router Timing | Checksum: 2a03f4a2e

Time (s): cpu = 00:00:24 ; elapsed = 00:00:16 . Memory (MB): peak = 1329.496 ; gain = 236.574
WARNING: [Route 35-455] Router was unable to fix hold violation on 2 pins because of high hold requirement. Such pins are:
	relockSweep/data_in[33]_i_2/I1
	relockSweep/data_in[25]_i_5/I0

Resolution: Run report_timing_summary to analyze the hold violations.
WARNING: [Route 35-459] Router was unable to fix hold violation on 17 pins. This could be due to a combination of congestion, blockages and run-time limitations. Such pins are:
	relockSweep/data_in[29]_i_2/I1
	relockSweep/data_in[25]_i_4/I0
	relockSweep/data_in[21]_i_5/I0
	relockSweep/data_in[29]_i_5/I0
	relockSweep/data_in[33]_i_5/I0
	relockSweep/data_in[21]_i_5/I1
	relockSweep/data_in[25]_i_3/I1
	relockSweep/data_in[21]_i_3/I0
	relockSweep/data_in[29]_i_2/I0
	relockSweep/data_in[29]_i_4/I1
	.. and 7 more pins.

Resolution: You may try high effort hold fixing by turning on param route.enableGlobalHoldIter.
