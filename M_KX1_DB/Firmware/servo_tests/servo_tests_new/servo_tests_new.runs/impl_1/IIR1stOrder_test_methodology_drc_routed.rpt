TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.004 ns between adc_sdo (clocked by VIRTUAL_ADC1/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[4]_0) and ADC1/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[2]_srl3_ADC1_LTC2195_SPI_inst_data_out_reg_c_1/D (clocked by ADC1/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[4]_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
