WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   AD9783_inst0/AD_9783_SPI_inst/trigger_in1 is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.

   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2240 - The MMCME2_ADV block
   <AD9783_inst1/MMCME2_BASE_inst> has CLKOUT pins that do not drive the same
   kind of BUFFER load. Routing from the different buffer types will not be
   phase aligned. 
DRC detected 0 errors and 4 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
