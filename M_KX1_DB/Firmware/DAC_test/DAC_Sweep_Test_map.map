ERROR:Place:1377 - Regional clock net "clk_in" is not routable with loads locked
   in different clock regions such that it will be impossible for the source to
   be routed to all loads. See below for a list of sample locked components in
   each clock region. For more information on the clock region rules, please
   refer to the architecture user's guide. To debug your design with partially
   routed design, please allow mapper/placer to finish the execution (by setting
   environment variable XIL_PAR_DEBUG_IOCLKPLACER to 1).
