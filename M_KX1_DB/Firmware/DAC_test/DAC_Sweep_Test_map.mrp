Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   4
Number of warnings :   2

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Place:1377 - Regional clock net "clk_in" is not routable with loads locked
   in different clock regions such that it will be impossible for the source to
   be routed to all loads. See below for a list of sample locked components in
   each clock region. For more information on the clock region rules, please
   refer to the architecture user's guide. To debug your design with partially
   routed design, please allow mapper/placer to finish the execution (by setting
   environment variable XIL_PAR_DEBUG_IOCLKPLACER to 1).
ERROR:Place:1377 - Regional clock net "clk_in" is not routable with loads locked
   in different clock regions such that it will be impossible for the source to
   be routed to all loads. See below for a list of sample locked components in
   each clock region. For more information on the clock region rules, please
   refer to the architecture user's guide. To debug your design with partially
   routed design, please allow mapper/placer to finish the execution (by setting
   environment variable XIL_PAR_DEBUG_IOCLKPLACER to 1).
ERROR:Place:1425 - Clock Net "clk_in" has 70 load components of type
   IOB/ILOGIC/OLOGIC/IDELAY/ODELAY, but within the chip scope in which the clock
   buffer can drive there are only 50 available sites. Please examine your
   design and consider to use suitable clocking schemes.
ERROR:Pack:1654 - The timing-driven placement phase encountered an error.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "clk" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "D1_out_n<15>" is not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 0.970 Volts. (default - Range: 0.970 to
   1.030 Volts)
INFO:Map:215 - The Interim Design Summary has been generated in the MAP Report
   (.mrp).

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   2 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   1 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "AD9783_inst0/pins[17].OBUFDS_inst" (OBUFDS) removed.
 The signal "AD9783_inst0/data_out_to_pins<17>" is loadless and has been removed.
Unused block "AD9783_inst0/pins[17].ODDR_inst" (ODDR) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC
