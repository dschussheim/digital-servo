Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:1107 - Pack was unable to combine the symbols listed below into a
   single IOB18M component because the site type selected is not compatible. 

   Further explanation:
   The component type is determined by the types of logic and the properties and
   configuration of the logic it contains. In this case an IO component of type
   IOB18M was chosen because the IO contains symbols and/or properties
   consistent with differential master usage and a IOSTANDARD=LVDS property.
   Please double check that the types of logic elements and all of their
   relevant properties and configuration options are compatible with the
   physical site type of the constraint.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "clk" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "D_out_n<15>" is not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
