See below for a list of sample locked components in each clock region. For more information on the clock region rules, please refer to the architecture user&apos;s guide. To debug your design with partially routed design, please allow mapper/placer to finish the execution (by setting environment variable XIL_PAR_DEBUG_IOCLKPLACER to 1).
