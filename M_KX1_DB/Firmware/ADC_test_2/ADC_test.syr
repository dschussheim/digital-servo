WARNING:Xst:1710 - FF/Latch <spi_data_15> (without init value) has a constant value of 0 in block <LTC2195>. This FF/Latch will be trimmed during the optimization process.
INFO:Xst:1901 - Instance MMCME2_BASE_inst in unit AD9783 of type MMCME2_BASE has been replaced by MMCME2_ADV
INFO:Xst:2261 - The FF/Latch <spi_data_8> in Unit <AD9783> is equivalent to the following FF/Latch, which will be removed : <spi_data_10> 
WARNING:Xst:3001 - This design contains one or more registers or latches with an active
   asynchronous set and asynchronous reset. While this circuit can be built,
   it creates a sub-optimal implementation in terms of area, power and
   performance. For a more optimal implementation Xilinx highly recommends
   one of the following:

          1) Remove either the set or reset from all registers and latches if
             not needed for required functionality
          2) Modify the code in order to produce a synchronous set
             and/or reset (both is preferred)
          3) Use the -async_to_sync option to transform the asynchronous
             set/reset to synchronous operation
             (timing simulation highly recommended when using this option)

  Please refer to http://www.xilinx.com search string "Kintex7 asynchronous set/reset" for more details.

(*) These 7 clock signal(s) are generated by combinatorial logic,
and XST is not able to identify which are the primary clock signals.
Please use the CLOCK_SIGNAL constraint to specify the clock signal(s) generated by combinatorial logic.
INFO:Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
