WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   AD9783_inst1/AD_9783_SPI_inst/trigger_in_data_in[10]_AND_17_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   ADC2/LTC2195_SPI_inst/trigger_in_data_in[5]_AND_27_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

   ADC2/LTC2195_SPI_inst/trigger_in_data_in[7]_AND_23_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
