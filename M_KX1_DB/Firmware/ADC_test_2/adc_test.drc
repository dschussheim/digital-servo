WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   AD9783_inst1/AD_9783_SPI_inst/trigger_in_data_in[10]_AND_17_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   ADC1/LTC2195_SPI_inst/trigger_in_data_in[5]_AND_27_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   ADC2/LTC2195_SPI_inst/trigger_in1 is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is
   not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into
   the flip-flop.

   ADC1/LTC2195_SPI_inst/trigger_in_data_in[7]_AND_23_o is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2455 - Unsupported clocking topology used for ISERDESE2
   <ADC1/pins[0].ISERDESE2_inst>. This can result in corrupted data. The CLK /
   CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type
   or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase
   relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported
   clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2455 - Unsupported clocking topology used for ISERDESE2
   <ADC2/pins[0].ISERDESE2_inst>. This can result in corrupted data. The CLK /
   CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type
   or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2455 - Unsupported clocking topology used for ISERDESE2
   <ADC2/pins[1].ISERDESE2_inst>. This can result in corrupted data. The CLK /
   CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type

   clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2240 - The MMCME2_ADV block <ADC1/MMCME2_ADV_inst> has
   CLKOUT pins that do not drive the same kind of BUFFER load. Routing from the
   different buffer types will not be phase aligned. 
DRC detected 0 errors and 11 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
