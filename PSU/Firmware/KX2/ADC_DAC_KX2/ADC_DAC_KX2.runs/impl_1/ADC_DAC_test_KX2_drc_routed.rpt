2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[7]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[7]_LDC_i_1/O, cell ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[7]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[8]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[8]_LDC_i_1/O, cell ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[8]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[9]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[9]_LDC_i_1/O, cell ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[9]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/state_f_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/state_f_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell ADC/LTC2195_SPI_inst/state_f_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net DAC0/AD_9783_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[7]_LDC_i_1__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin DAC0/AD_9783_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[7]_LDC_i_1__0/O, cell DAC0/AD_9783_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[7]_LDC_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net DAC0/AD_9783_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[8]_LDC_i_1__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin DAC0/AD_9783_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[8]_LDC_i_1__0/O, cell DAC0/AD_9783_SPI_inst/data_out_reg[8]_LDC_i_1__0.
